# aad64_Matrix-Build
GitHub Actions Matrix Build for Multiple Python Versions

## Summary:
This project was created to test out GitHub Actions using Matrix Builds (i.e., testing the entire project using different versions of Python). For the same, the yml files were edited to accommodate extra versions of Python. One additional yml file was created to test Python version 3.7 as well.

The rest of this assignment is a reflection of the individual project compressed into less number of files (on script file and one test file, with no jupyter notebook).
